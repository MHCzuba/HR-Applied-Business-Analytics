This report presents the findings of a publicly available HR dataset that contains 311 observations of 39 variables. Rather than a business enabler, the human resources department is often looked at as a cost center; through the business questions posed below, I aimed to look at solutions that would reduce overall labor expenses in the long run, rather than the short run. After reviewing and cleaning the data, summary statistics and plots were formed as the basis for support vector machine and linear regression modeling. Some important measures in this dataset are gender, salary, turnover, employee satisfaction, and special project counts. All active employees in this dataset were full-time and an assumption was made that terminated employees were full-time as well. This dataset was last updated October 2020. 

This dataset seeks to answer the following questions:
1.	Where is turnover occurring and what is its impact?
2.	Where are absences occurring and what is its impact?
3.	Is there evidence of discrimination or mistreatment?
4.	What strategies can be put into place to reduce or defer termination and absenteeism?
